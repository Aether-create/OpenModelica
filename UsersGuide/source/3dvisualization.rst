================

.. highlight:: modelica

New in OpenModelica 1.11 is that OMEdit has built-in 3D visualization,
which replaces third-party libraries (such as `Modelica3D
<https://github.com/OpenModelica/Modelica3D>`_) for 3D visualization.

  Add screenshots and user's guide for the visualization.
